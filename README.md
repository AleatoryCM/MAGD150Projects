### Project 1

[City Sketch](https://github.com/OchowskiAM/MAGD150Projects/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab10a_ochowski/f17magd150lab10a_ochowski.pde)

This sketch was the first I created using Processing. It uses only geometric primitives to display a city at night. Originally, it was black and white as well. However, I later added yellow to emphasize the sources of light, and also constructed a gradient to simulate real moonlight.


### Project 2

[Oceans of Pizza](https://github.com/OchowskiAM/MAGD150Projects/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab04_ochowski/f17magd150lab04_ochowski.pde)

This is the first game I made using processing. Scoring is console based, and the instructions are commented in to the top. Though the controls and ideas are simple, it stands out in different ways, such as the prescence of "speaking" characters.
*These characters are named after individuals from the Shadow of Revan expansion of Star Wars: The Old Republic. I do not own the names Margok, Coratanni, and Ruugar, nor did I create them. All names are creative property solely of their creators or owners.


### Project 3

[ShapeCast](https://github.com/OchowskiAM/MAGD150Projects/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab05_ochowski/f17magd150lab05_ochowski.pde)

This sketch is notable chiefly for its usage of buttons. Consisting only of a TV that switches between four static news channels, each named after a shape, functionality is constrained to the Up, Down, & Power buttons. I am especially proud of the attention to detail present in this sketch; inaccuracies like being able to change the channel when the TV is off or having the TV default to channel 1 every time it is turned on have been identified and rooted out.


### Project 4

[Kite Hunter](https://github.com/OchowskiAM/MAGD150Projects/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab06_ochowski/f17magd150lab06_ochowski.pde)

Probably my favorite Processing sketch to date, Kite Hunter is a complete game with in-window scoring, lives, instructions, and difficulty-scaling mechanics, as well as a restart button. The player uses two keys to move a cloud left and right across the top of the screen, and uses a third to summon a lightning strike against any clouds below.


### Project 5

[Bumper Cars](https://github.com/OchowskiAM/MAGD150Projects/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab07_ochowski/f17magd150lab07_ochowski.pde)

The most ambitious one-man project I have taken on, Bumper Cars attempts to simulate the classic carnival / themepark attraction. The player controls a bumper car, and must attempt to engage in as many (severe) collisions as possible within the time limit to beat their high score. As I'm not known for my physics knowledge, that part of the game remains a bit sketchy, but as a game, it is still fully operational.
